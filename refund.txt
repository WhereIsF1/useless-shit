Hewwo there, Windscribe-chan! (≧◡≦) 💨💌

Uwu, I've been a naughty user, haven't I? (〃ω〃) I'm soooo sowwy for not using your super-duper service correctly. M-my bad! (>_<) I didn't mean to cause any trouble, honest! I didn't mean to be a jackass... I mean, a meanie-bo-beanie! (｡•́︿•̀｡) 💔💔💔

I was enjoying your awesome VPN service, and I guess I just got carried away... (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)⁄ Maybe I was a little bit too enthusiastic? Teehee! (>.<)💦

I know I've made some boo-boos, and you have every right to be upset with me, Windscribe-chan. I understand if you need to terminate or suspend my access... I've been a bad user, after all. (｡•́︿•̀｡)🚫🚀

But uh-oh! I have a teensy-weensy favor to ask you... (〃ω〃) Could you, pretty please with a cherry on top, consider giving me a refund? I know, I know! I'm not really eligible anymore... but I promise I've learned my lesson! (｡•́︿•̀｡)💰🔄

I pinky-promise to be a good user from now on! Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a cupcake in my eye! (〃ω〃)🧁👀🤞 I'll respect your rules and be the best user ever! If I get another chance, I'll make you proud, Windscribe-chan! (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)⁄💖🌈

Thankies a whole bunch for listening to my apology, Windscribe-chan! Even if you can't refund me, I still think you're the best VPN service in the whole wide world! ^ω^🌍💖

Big hugs and sparkly unicorn wishes! (≧◡≦)✨🦄
